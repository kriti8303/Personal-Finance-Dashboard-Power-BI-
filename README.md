## Problem Description : 
As one should, I have been keeping track of all my daily spending using Microsoft Excel. Using basic sorting/filtering in Excel I'm able to see a very high-level overview of my spending. In order to perform data analysis at a more deeper level, we will turn my static Excel data into dynamic PowerBI dashboards.

## Project Goals : 
Here are the questions I would like the PowerBI dashboards to answer:

1. Monthly spending (in a given year).
2. How much money spent per item category.
3. List all expenses with comments.
4. How much money spent per location.
5. The number of purchases in various price ranges.
6. Quarterly and weekly spending information.
7. Various average costs (per week, month, day).
8. Comparison of food costs to restaurant costs.
9. Spending behavior when I'm sick.
10. Comparison of weekday and weekend spending.

In order to answer these questions, I invested time in planning the PowerBI measures I would need to create and also planned a rough outline of the dashboard visuals I wanted.

## Conclusion : 
Using PowerBI I was able to visualize my purchases data in an interactive way. This allowed me to drill deeper into my spending behaviour and with this information I can now be more conscientious of what I choose to spend my money on.
